**ML Based Anomaly Detection In System Security**
This Project integrates the concept of Operating Systems and Machine Learning to yeild a model that detects and classifies log entries in a system as either harmfull or not using a pre-generated dataset that consists of randomly generated log entries. These simulated log entries are for simulations only.
